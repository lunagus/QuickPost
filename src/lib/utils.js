// Helper functions if needed
// Currently the blueprint puts ID generation directly in upload.js
// but the directory structure lists this file. 
// I will leave it empty or add generic helpers if I see them later, 
// strictly following the user's provided code structure.
// The blueprint didn't provide content for this file, so I will populate it 
// with a placeholder or simple export to avoid import errors if referenced,
// though currently it's not referenced in the provided code snippets.
